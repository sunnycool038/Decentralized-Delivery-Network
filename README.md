## Introduction

The Decentralized Delivery Network is a blockchain-based system implemented using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. It aims to create a trustless, efficient, and transparent platform for package delivery services.

This system connects package senders with couriers, facilitates secure payments, and provides a rating system for service quality assurance. By leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures transparency, reduces intermediaries, and potentially lowers costs compared to traditional centralized delivery services.

## Features

- Create and track packages as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- Register as a courier
- Accept packages for delivery
- Complete deliveries with automatic payment transfer
- Rate couriers based on service quality
- View package and courier details

## Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain environment
- Clarity language knowledge
- A Stacks wallet (for interacting with the contract)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sunnycool038/decentralized-delivery-network.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd decentralized-delivery-network
   ```
3. Deploy the smart contract to the Stacks blockchain (refer to Stacks documentation for specific deployment instructions)

## Smart Contract Overview

The smart contract (`decentralized-delivery-network.clar`) is the core of this system. It defines the following main components:

- Data maps for packages and couriers
- Non-Fungible Token (NFT) for package representation
- Public functions for interacting with the network
- Read-only functions for retrieving data

## Usage

Interact with the smart contract using a Stacks wallet or through a custom frontend application. The main interactions include:

1. Creating a package delivery request
2. Registering as a courier
3. Accepting a package for delivery
4. Completing a delivery
5. Rating a courier

## Functions

### Public Functions

1. `create-package`: Create a new package delivery request
2. `register-courier`: Register as a courier in the network
3. `accept-package`: Accept a package for delivery (courier only)
4. `complete-delivery`: Mark a package as delivered and transfer payment
5. `rate-courier`: Rate a courier after delivery completion

### Read-Only Functions

1. `get-package-details`: Retrieve details of a specific package
2. `get-courier-details`: Retrieve details of a specific courier

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that only authorized parties can create packages and register as couriers
- Implement additional checks to prevent fraudulent activities
- Consider adding a dispute resolution mechanism
- Regularly audit the smart contract for potential vulnerabilities

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a reputation system for both couriers and package senders
- Add support for different types of packages (e.g., express delivery, fragile items)
- Integrate with decentralized identity solutions for enhanced security
- Implement a decentralized governance system for network parameters
- Add support for multiple cryptocurrencies as payment options
